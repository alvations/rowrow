Hal Yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out .	NP NP BEDZ IN AT AP TO VB IN AT NN CC IN AT OD TO VB RP .
He had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of Ozagen , Siddo .	PPS HVD TO VB AT NNS IN AT NN IN AT NN NN IN NP , NP .
And , from the first , he faced a difficult task .	CC , IN AT RB , PPS VBD AT JJ NN .
The expedition that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words .	AT NN WPS HVD VBN NP HVD VBN IN VBG CD CD NP NNS IN AT JJ NN IN JJ NNS .
The description of the Siddo syntax was very restricted .	AT NN IN AT NP NN BEDZ QL VBN .
And , as Hal found out , obviously mistaken in many cases .	CC , CS NP VBD RP , RB VBN IN AP NNS .
This discovery caused Hal anxiety .	DT NN VBD NP NN .
His duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the Gabriel how to speak Ozagen .	PP$ NN BEDZ TO VB AT NN NN CC TO VB AT JJ NNS IN AT NP WRB TO VB NP .
Yet , if he used all of the little means at his disposal , he would be instructing his students wrongly .	RB , CS PPS VBD ABN IN AT AP NNS IN PP$ NN , PPS MD BE VBG PP$ NNS RB .
Moreover , even getting this across would be difficult .	RB , RB VBG DT RB MD BE JJ .
For one thing , the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed somewhat from Earthmen's ; ;	IN CD NN , AT NNS IN NN IN AT NP NNS VBD RB IN NPS$ . .
the sounds made by these organs were , therefore , dissimilar .	AT NNS VBN IN DTS NNS BED , RB , JJ .
It was true that they could be approximated , but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations ? ?	PPS BEDZ JJ CS PPSS MD BE VBN , CC MD AT NPS VB DTS NNS . .
Another obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo .	DT NN BEDZ AT JJ NN IN NP .
Consider the tense system .	VB AT NN NN .
Instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future , Siddo used an entirely different word .	RB IN VBG AT NN CC VBG AT JJ NN TO VB AT NN CC NN , NP VBD AT RB JJ NN .
Thus , the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai , meaning to live , was , in the perfect tense , ksu'u'peli'afo , and , in the future , mai'teipa .	RB , AT JJ JJ NN FW-VB , VBG TO VB , BEDZ , IN AT JJ NN , FW-VB , CC , IN AT NN , FW-NN .
The same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses .	AT AP NN IN AT RB JJ NN VBD IN ABN AT AP NNS .
Plus the fact that Siddo not only had the normal ( to Earthmen ) three genders of masculine , feminine , and neuter , but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual .	IN AT NN CS NP * RB HVD AT JJ ( IN NPS ) CD NNS IN JJ , JJ , CC JJ , CC AT CD JJ IN JJ CC JJ .
Fortunately , gender was inflected , though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo .	RB , NN BEDZ VBN , CS AT NN IN PPO MD BE JJ IN PN * VBN IN NP .
The system of indicating gender varied according to tense .	AT NN IN VBG NN VBD RB IN NN .
All the other parts of speech : nouns , pronouns , adjectives , adverbs , and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs .	QL AT AP NNS IN NN : NNS , NNS , NNS , NNS , CC NNS VBD IN AT AP NN CS AT NNS .
This was not , for the Angel , just a matter of running through a logical or deductive chain , or deciding on some action from some already established premise .	DT BEDZ * , IN AT NN-TL , RB AT NN IN VBG IN AT JJ CC JJ NN , CC VBG RP DTI NN IN DTI RB VBN NN .
No doubt the Angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer .	AT NN AT NNS-TL MD DO DT NN IN NN QL JJ CS DTI NN .
What Gabriel was being asked to do now , however , was to re-examine all his basic assumptions , make value-judgments on them , and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives .	WDT NP BEDZ BEG VBN TO DO RB , WRB , BEDZ TO VB ABN PP$ JJ NNS , VB NNS IN PPO , CC VB PPO JJ CC JJ NNS IN PP$ NN TO VB PP$ NNS .

What limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me .	WDT VBD NN PPS VBD PPS VBD IN PPO .
In the mornings , I was informed , fluorescent tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminated the entire hall .	IN AT NNS , PPSS BEDZ VBN , JJ NNS , JJ IN AT CD IN AT NN , VBD AT JJ NN .

The black Fudo seemed to stare rigidly back at him and Richard's eyes were caught by the Fudo's in fascination , and then Richard was shocked as , all at once , flames shot out from the sharp features of Fudo's face and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound , as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it .

Her hair was the color of those blooms which in seed catalogues are referred to as `` black '' , but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue -- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers , searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness .

In a frenzy of excitement , he considered his plan .	IN AT NN IN NN , PPS VBD PP$ NN .
Beside his shorts , he would place something of hers .	IN PP$ NNS , PPS MD VB PN IN PP$$ .
Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same .

The tale , he thought , would become less gay .	AT NN , PPS VBD , MD VB QL JJ .
