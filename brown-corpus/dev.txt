If a litigant chooses to enforce a Federal right in a State court , he cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are plaintiffs who press like claims arising under State law with regard to the form in which the claim must be stated -- the particularity , for instance , with which a cause of action must be described .

A recent case in point is Mitchell Canneries v.

Holding the final corporation entitled to sue on the claim , the Court cited the Seaboard , Novo Trading , and Roomberg cases for the proposition that `` transfers by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not assignments prohibited by the statute '' .

In an earlier case , Kingan & Co. v.

The transaction presumably would have qualified under section 368(a)(1) as a contractual reorganization , followed by a section 332 liquidation , but not under section 368(a)(1) as a statutory merger of consolidation .

Revenue Ruling 54-17 provides that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been liquidated by merger with a successor corporation , a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax , followed by the name of the successor corporation .

These results appear sound .	DTS NNS VB JJ .
As stated in Seaboard and numerous other cases , the two primary reasons for the enactment of section 203 of the United States Code were to prevent the Government from having to deal with more than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claims on a contingent-fee basis .	CS VBN IN NN-TL CC JJ AP NNS , AT CD JJ NNS IN AT NN IN NN CD IN AT VBN-TL NNS-TL NN-TL BED TO VB AT NN-TL IN HVG TO VB IN AP IN CD NN CC TO VB AT NN IN JJ NNS IN AT NN NN .
The cases have allowed transfer of claims if beneficial ownership is not changed .	AT NNS HV VBN NN IN NNS CS JJ NN BEZ * VBN .
The first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section 381(a) , which is the only type presently under discussion .	AT OD NN MD RB VB IN AT NN NN WDT VBZ AT NNS IN NN CD , WDT BEZ AT AP NN RB IN NN .
Section 381(a) applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent , a statutory merger or consolidation , an acquisition of substantially all a corporation's assets solely in exchange for voting stock , or a change of identity , form , or place of organization .

In virtually every case the transferor corporation is liquidated , and its former stockholders either own outright , or have a continuing stock interest in , the assets which gave rise to the tax .	IN RB AT NN AT NN NN BEZ VBN , CC PP$ AP NNS CC VB RB , CC HV AT VBG NN NN IN , AT NNS WDT VBD NN IN AT NN .
In these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting claims is exceedingly remote .	IN DTS NNS AT NN IN JJ CC VBG NNS BEZ QL JJ .
Furthermore , in a C reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger , to which the statute is clearly inapplicable .

Nor is it at all likely that a `` desperate '' claim against the Government will be assigned on a contingent-fee basis in the guise of a tax-free reorganization .	CC BEZ PPS IN ABN JJ CS AT `` JJ '' NN IN AT NN-TL MD BE VBN IN AT NN NN IN AT NN IN AT JJ NN .
If the transferor has substantial assets other than the claim , it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes .	CS AT NN HVZ JJ NNS AP CS AT NN , PPS VBZ JJ TO VB AT NN MD BE JJ TO VB ABN IN PP$ NNS IN AT JJ NN IN VBG AT NN IN NN IN NNS .
If such an unlikely transaction were to take place , it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase , followed by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary , followed by liquidation .	CS ABL AT JJ NN BED TO VB NN , PPS MD QL RB BE VBN IN AT NN NN , VBN IN AT NN IN AT NN IN AT JJ NN , VBN IN NN .
In the rare case where a corporation's only substantial asset , or its most important one , is a claim for refund , perhaps its transfer should not be permitted , whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets for stock .

It appears , then , that although the matter is not dealt with in section 381(c) , a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specified in section 381(a) is entitled to sue for refund of taxes paid by a transferor corporation .

Other tax attributes of the transferor	AP-HL NN-HL NNS-HL IN-HL AT-HL NN-HL

Legal considerations	JJ-HL NNS-HL
First , let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved .	RB , VB PPO VB RB DTI IN AT JJ NNS VBN .
It is an accepted juridical principle in California that a Superior Court decision does not constitute a binding legal precedent .	PPS BEZ AT VBN JJ NN IN NP CS AT JJ-TL NN-TL NN DOZ * VB AT VBG JJ NN .
It is conclusive , unless appealed , only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard .	PPS BEZ JJ , CS VBN , RB IN AT AP NNS IN AT AP NN WDT BEDZ VBN .
It is not binding upon another Superior Court , which could rule to the contrary .	PPS BEZ * VBG IN DT JJ-TL NN-TL , WDT MD VB IN AT NN .
Only when a decision is rendered by the District Court of Appeal ( or , of course , the Supreme Court ) is a binding precedent established .	RB WRB AT NN BEZ VBN IN AT NN-TL NN-TL IN-TL NN-TL ( CC , IN NN , AT JJ-TL NN-TL ) BEZ AT VBG NN VBN .
In that event , we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation of the matter , and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be overthrown in other Superior Courts .

But over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent decision , I am convinced that the decisions of the Superior Courts which in effect nullify the Secretary's Regulation are not a correct interpretation of the Secretary's power under the Federal law .

Further , and as an evidence of legislative intent only , the Senate of the United States recently defeated by a substantial majority the `` Holland Amendment '' to the Fair Labor Standards Act , which would have specifically limited the regulatory authority of the Secretary in these matters .

The ramifications of the issue are enormous .	AT NNS IN AT NN BER JJ .

To have applied statewide the decisions of the two cases heard in Superior Court , in my opinion , would have placed us clearly out of compliance with the Wagner-Peyser Act and would have immediately opened the way for the Secretary of Labor , were he so inclined , to notify the Governor of such noncompliance , set a date for hearing , and issue his finding .

Why the teacher should study the individual pupil	WRB-HL AT-HL NN-HL MD-HL VB-HL AT-HL JJ-HL NN-HL
Much progress has been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding children , yet in almost any classroom today can be found children whose needs are not being met by the school program .	AP NN HVZ BEN VBN IN AT AP CD NNS IN VBG NNS IN VBG NNS , CC IN RB DTI NN NR MD BE VBN NNS WP$ NNS BER * BEG VBN IN AT NN NN .
Some are failing to achieve as much as their ability would permit ; ;	DTI BER VBG TO VB QL AP CS PP$ NN MD VB . .
others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom .	NNS RB VB JJ TO VB RB IN AT NN IN AT NN .
These children have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults who did not understand .	DTS NNS HV BEN VBN CS DTS WPS BED VBG TO VB PN IN NNS WPS DOD * VB .
Many school systems now employ school psychologists and child guidance specialists .	AP NN NNS RB VB NN NNS CC NN NN NNS .
These specialists perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention , by suggesting ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular classroom , and by providing clinical services for severely maladjusted children .	DTS NNS VB JJ NNS IN VBG NNS VB TO VB NNS WPS VB JJ NN , IN VBG NNS IN VBG AT NNS IN JJ NNS IN AT JJ NN , CC IN VBG JJ NNS IN QL JJ NNS .
It is the classroom teacher , however , who has daily contacts with pupils , and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice .	PPS BEZ AT NN NN , RB , WPS HVZ JJ NNS IN NNS , CC WPS BEZ IN AT JJ NN TO VB JJ JJ NNS IN NN .
Indeed , a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work of the elementary-school teacher , rather than merely an additional chore .	RB , AT NN IN AT JJ NN BEZ AT JJ NN IN AT NN IN AT NN NN , RB CS RB AT JJ NN .
Teachers and administrators in many elementary schools have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the basis of test scores solves the problem of meeting the needs of individuals .	NNS CC NNS IN AP JJ NNS HV VBN CS VBG AT NNS IN DTI NN IN NNS IN AT NN IN NN NNS VBZ AT NN IN VBG AT NNS IN NNS .
What they should recognize is that children who have been placed in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attributes that influence success , and that they still must be treated as individuals .	WDT PPSS MD VB BEZ CS NNS WPS HV BEN VBN IN CD IN DTS NNS IN AT JJ JJ NN RB VB RB IN NNS WPS VB NN , CC CS PPSS RB MD BE VBN CS NNS .

Factors that inhibit learning and lead to maladjustment	NNS-HL WPS-HL VB-HL VBG-HL CC-HL VB-HL IN-HL NN-HL
Studies conducted in various sections of the United States indicate that many children in elementary schools are maladjusted emotionally , and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects .	NNS VBN IN AP NNS IN AT VBN-TL NNS-TL VB CS AP NNS IN JJ NNS BER JJ RB , CC CS AP IN PPO BER VBG TO VB JJ NN IN NN NNS .
One study , which involved 1,524 pupils in grades one to six , found that 12 percent of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading a year below capacity .	CD NN , WDT VBD CD NNS IN NNS CD IN CD , VBD CS CD NN IN AT NNS BED QL JJ CC CS CD NN BED VBG AT NN IN NN .
It is apparent , therefore , that the teacher needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children .	PPS BEZ JJ , RB , CS AT NN VBZ TO VB WDT NNS HV AT JJ NN IN AT NN CC NN IN NNS .
When a child fails to meet the standards of the school in his rate of learning , insecurity , unhappiness , and other forms of maladjustment frequently follow .	WRB AT NN VBZ TO VB AT NNS IN AT NN IN PP$ NN IN VBG , NN , NN , CC AP NNS IN NN RB VB .
These maladjustments in turn inhibit learning , and a vicious cycle is completed .	DTS NNS IN NN VB VBG , CC AT JJ NN BEZ VBN .
It is easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy , or that the child who lacks interest in school , who dislikes the teacher , or who is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent .

AT NNS IN NN CC NN MD BE VBN IN JJ NNS , JJ CS JJ NN CC NN , VBN NN , JJ NN NN , AT JJ NN , JJ NN , NN , CC JJ NN .

They may be related to mental immaturity or lack of aptitude for certain types of school work .	PPSS MD BE VBN IN JJ NN CC NN IN NN IN AP NNS IN NN NN .
The curriculum may be too difficult for some and too easy for others .	AT NN MD BE QL JJ IN DTI CC QL JJ IN NNS .
Teaching methods , learning materials , and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead to maladjustments for some children .	VBG NNS , VBG NNS , CC NN NNS MD VB VBG CC VB IN NNS IN DTI NNS .
Unwholesome family relations , broken homes , and undesirable community influences may also be contributing factors .	JJ NN NNS , VBN NNS , CC JJ NN NNS MD RB BE VBG NNS .
This is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit learning and contribute to maladjustment among children .	DT BEZ RB AT JJ NN IN AT NNS WPS VB VBG CC VB IN NN IN NNS .
Moreover , these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner .	RB , DTS NNS DO * VB ABN NNS IN AT AP NN .

The educational profession	AT-HL JJ-HL NN-HL
The members of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy , their position being strongest in the universities .	AT NNS IN AT JJ NN HV AT JJ NN IN AT NN IN JJ NN , PP$ NN BEG JJT IN AT NNS .

In a society dominated by middle-class values and working in an institution which transmits and strengthens these social values , it is clear that the educational profession must work for the values which are characteristic of the society .

1 .	CD-HL .-HL
The double-step type	AT-HL NN-HL NN-HL
Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice .	IN AT NN JJ IN PP$ NN RB TO VB `` JJ NNS '' , AT JJ NN IN RB VBN NN VBZ RB QL RB CS PN MD VB IN VBG AT JJ NN IN AT NN .
For more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses .	IN QL JJ NNS , PN MD VB JJ NNS IN NNS .
By all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution .	IN ABN NNS AT QL JJ NN BEZ DT IN DTS NN NNS WDT VB AT NN IN RB JJ NN NNS IN NNS IN JJ CC JJ NNS , CC DTS AP NNS WDT VB AT NN IN JJ NN NN CC JJ NN NN .
The first , or double-step , type might also be called the `` railroad type '' because of its application to railroads ( and other transportation agencies ) by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission .	AT OD , CC NN , NN MD RB BE VBN AT `` NN NN '' RB IN PP$ NN IN NNS ( CC AP NN NNS ) IN AT NN-TL NN-TL IN AT JJ-TL NN-TL NN-TL .
The Cost Section distinguishes between ( directly ) variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter .	AT NN-TL NN-TL VBZ IN ( RB ) JJ NNS CC JJ NNS IN AT NN VBN IN AT VBG NN .
The variable costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing `` long-run out-of-pocket costs '' -- a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of the economist's `` long-run marginal costs '' .	AT JJ NNS RB BER VBN IN AT JJ NNS IN NN NN CS VBG `` NN JJ NNS '' -- AT NN IN AT NN RB * RB JJ IN DT IN AT NN$ `` NN JJ NNS '' .
There remains a residue of total costs , or total `` revenue requirements '' which , since it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density , is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis .	EX VBZ AT NN IN JJ NNS , CC JJ `` NN NNS '' WDT , CS PPS BEZ VBN TO VB CS CS PPS BED JJ IN JJ NNS IN NN NN , BEZ RB JJ IN AT JJ NN .
Nevertheless , because the Cost Section has felt impelled to make some kind of a distribution of total costs , it has apportioned this residue , which it sometimes calls `` burden '' , among the units of carload traffic on a basis ( partly ton , partly ton-mile ) which is concededly quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination .	RB , CS AT NN-TL NN-TL HVZ VBN VBN TO VB DTI NN IN AT NN IN JJ NNS , PPS HVZ VBN DT NN , WDT PPS RB VBZ `` NN '' , IN AT NNS IN NN NN IN AT NN ( RB NN , RB NN ) WDT BEZ RB QL JJ IN AT NN IN NN NN .
In recent years , this burden ( which includes allowances for revenue deficiencies in the passenger business and in less-than-carload freight traffic ! !	IN JJ NNS , DT NN ( WDT VBZ NNS IN NN NNS IN AT NN NN CC IN JJ NN NN . .
) has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet .	) HVZ VBN IN RB CD NN IN DTS JJ NN NNS WDT AT NN NN NN BEZ VBN TO BE VBN RB TO VB .
Since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad rates , it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission has estimated out-of-pocket costs and apportioned residue costs .

Suffice it to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment is questionable .	VB PPO TO VB CS AT NN IN AT AP NN BEZ JJ .
But in any event , full credit should be given to the Cost Section for its express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost analyses : namely , that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service ; ;	CC IN DTI NN , JJ NN MD BE VBN IN AT NN-TL NN-TL IN PP$ JJ CC JJ NN IN AT JJ NN QL RB VBN IN NN NNS : RB , DT IN AT NN NN VBN TO VB AT JJ NN IN NNS IN NN IN NNS IN NNS IN NN IN JJ NNS IN NN NN . .

The single-step type	AT-HL NN-HL NN-HL
We turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which , unlike the `` railroad type '' , draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost apportionment : the single-step type .	PPSS VB RB IN AT NN IN RB VBN NN NN WDT , IN AT `` NN NN '' , VBZ AT NN IN NN NN CC NN NN : AT NN NN .
It might be called the `` public utility '' type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases .	PPS MD BE VBN AT `` JJ NN '' NN RB IN AT JJ NN IN WDT PPS HVZ BEN VBN IN NN CC NN NN NN NNS .
Here no attempt is made , first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose on these costs `` reasonably distributed '' residues of total costs .	RB AT NN BEZ VBN , RB TO VB JJ CC JJ NNS CC RB TO VB IN DTS NNS `` RB VBN '' NNS IN JJ NNS .
Instead , all of the total costs are treated as variable costs , although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables .	RB , ABN IN AT JJ NNS BER VBN CS JJ NNS , CS DTS NNS BER VBN IN NNS WPS BER VBN TO BE NNS IN JJ NNS .
Moreover , whereas in Interstate Commerce Commission parlance `` variable cost '' means a cost deemed to vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output , in the type of analysis now under review `` variable cost '' has been used more broadly , so as to cover costs which , while a function of some one variable ( such as output of energy , or number of customers ) , are not necessarily a linear function .	RB , CS IN JJ-TL NN-TL NN-TL NN `` JJ NN '' NNS AT NN VBN TO VB IN JJ NN IN NNS IN NN IN NN , IN AT NN IN NN RB IN NN `` JJ NN '' HVZ BEN VBN QL RB , CS CS TO VB NNS WDT , CS AT NN IN DTI CD JJ ( JJ CS NN IN NN , CC NN IN NNS ) , BER * RB AT JJ NN .
As already noted in an earlier paragraph , the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service , such as residential , commercial , industrial power , street lighting , etc. .	CS RB VBN IN AT JJR NN , AT QL JJ NN NNS IN NN NNS CC NN NNS VB AT JJ NNS IN AT NN IN JJ NNS IN NN , JJ CS JJ , JJ , JJ NN , NN NN , RB .
This `` grand division '' permits many costs to be assigned in their entirety to some one class , such as street lighting , or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes .	DT `` JJ NN '' VBZ AP NNS TO BE VBN IN PP$ NN IN DTI CD NN , JJ CS NN NN , CC IN AP TO BE VBN RB IN DTI JJ NN CC NNS .
High-tension industrial power service , for example , would not be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the low-tension distribution lines .	NN JJ NN NN , IN NN , MD * BE VBN IN DTI NN IN AT NN NNS CC NN NNS IN AT NN NN NNS .
But the major portions of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all , or nearly all , classes of customers ; ;	CC AT JJ NNS IN AT JJ NNS IN AT NN NN BER JJ CC JJ IN ABN , CC RB ABN , NNS IN NNS . .
and these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates .	CC DTS NNS MD RB BE VBN IN AT AP NNS CC RB MD RB BE VBN IN AT NNS IN NN IN NN TO VB NN NNS WPS MD VB CS JJ NNS IN JJ NNS .
The general basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem of an electric-utility cost analysis .	AT JJ NN IN WDT DTS JJ NNS BER VBN IN RB VBN NNS IN NN MD BE VBN IN AT VBG QL VBN NN IN AT NN NN NN .
But before turning to this example , we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis , both of which belong to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type .	CC CS VBG IN DT NN , PPSS MD VB CD NNS IN NN , ABX IN WDT VB IN AT NN NN RB CS IN AT NN NN .
In the first subtype , the analyst ( following the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect ) distributes both total operating costs and total annual capital costs ( including an allowance for `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' ) among the different classes and units of service .	IN AT OD NN , AT NN ( VBG AT NN IN NN NN IN DT AP NN ) VBZ ABX JJ VBG NNS CC JJ JJ NN NNS ( IN AT NN IN `` NN IN NN '' CC `` JJ NN IN NN '' ) IN AT JJ NNS CC NNS IN NN .
Here , an apportionment , say , of $5,000,000 of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers .	RB , AT NN , UH , IN NNS IN AT JJ NNS IN JJ NN CS AT NN MD VB AT NN IN RB CD IN NN CS AT NN IN WDT NN BEZ VBN TO HV BEN VBN IN AT NN IN AT JJ NNS .
But in the second subtype , which I take to be the one more frequently applied , only the operating expenses and not the `` cost of capital '' or `` fair return '' are apportioned directly among the various classes of service .	CC IN AT OD NN , WDT PPSS VB TO BE AT CD QL RB VBN , RB AT VBG NNS CC * AT `` NN IN NN '' CC `` JJ NN '' BER VBN RB IN AT AP NNS IN NN .
To be sure , the capital investments in ( or , alternatively , the estimated `` fair values '' of ) the plant and equipment are apportioned among the different classes , as are also the gross revenues received from the sales of the different services .	TO BE JJ , AT NN NNS IN ( CC , RB , AT VBN `` JJ NNS '' IN ) AT NN CC NN BER VBN IN AT JJ NNS , CS BER RB AT JJ NNS VBN IN AT NNS IN AT JJ NNS .
But any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a `` return '' realized on the capital investment attributed to the same service .	CC DTI VBG NN IN NNS VBN IN AT VBN NN IN NN IN AT VBG NNS VBN IN DT NN BEZ VBN CS AT `` NN '' VBN IN AT NN NN VBN IN AT AP NN .
Thus , during any given year ( A ) if the revenues from the residential service are $7,000,000 , ( B ) if the operating expenses imputed to this class of service come to $5,000,000 , and ( C ) if the net investment in ( or value of ) the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to $30,000,000 , the cost analyst will report that residential service , in the aggregate , has yielded a return of $2,000,000 or 6-2/3 per cent .	RB , IN DTI VBN NN ( NP ) CS AT NNS IN AT JJ NN BER NNS , ( NP ) CS AT VBG NNS VBN IN DT NN IN NN VB IN NNS , CC ( NP ) CS AT JJ NN IN ( CC NN IN ) AT NN CC NN VBN VBN IN DT NN VBZ IN NNS , AT NN NN MD VB CS JJ NN , IN AT NN , HVZ VBN AT NN IN NNS CC CD IN NN .
Other services will show different rates of return , some probably much lower and some higher .	AP NNS MD VB JJ NNS IN NN , DTI RB QL JJR CC DTI JJR .
There are obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding `` cost of capital '' from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different classes of service -- notably , the avoidance of the controversial question what rate of return should be held to constitute `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' .	EX BER JJ NNS IN NN IN DT NN IN VBG `` NN IN NN '' IN AT JJ NN IN JJ NNS IN AT JJ NNS IN NN -- RB , AT NN IN AT JJ NN WDT NN IN NN MD BE VBN TO VB `` NN IN NN '' CC `` JJ NN IN NN '' .
But the practice is likely to be misleading , since it may seem to support a conclusion that , as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating expenses plus some return on capital investment , however low , the rates of charge for this service are compensatory .

Needless to say , any such inference would be quite unwarranted .	JJ TO VB , DTI JJ NN MD BE QL JJ .
For the reason just suggested , I shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed cost apportionment in the following simplified example .	IN AT NN RB VBN , PPSS MD VB AT NN IN AT OD NN IN RB VBN NN NN IN AT VBG VBN NN .
That is to say , an allowance for `` cost of capital '' will be assumed to be included directly in the cost apportionment .	DT BEZ TO VB , AT NN IN `` NN IN NN '' MD BE VBN TO BE VBN RB IN AT NN NN .
Three-part analysis of the costs of an electric utility business	JJ-HL NN-HL IN-HL AT-HL NNS-HL IN-HL AT-HL NN-HL NN-HL NN-HL
In order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis , let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation plant .	IN NN TO VB AT NN IN AT JJ RB VBN NN NN , VB PPO VB AT NN IN AT NN IN AT NN NN NN VBG AT AP NN IN NN VBN IN PP$ JJ NN NN .
Let us also assume the existence of only one class or type of service , all of which is supplied at the same voltage , phase , etc. to residential , commercial , and industrial customers .	VB PPO RB VB AT NN IN RB CD NN CC NN IN NN , ABN IN WDT BEZ VBN IN AT AP NN , NN , RB IN JJ , JJ , CC JJ NNS .
This latter assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost analysis -- the distinction among costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along different dimensions .	DT AP NN MD VB PPO TO VB NN IN AT QL JJ NN IN JJ JJ NN NN NN -- AT NN IN NNS WPS BER NNS IN NNS IN AT AP NN VBN IN JJ NNS .
Since the company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service , we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple ; ;	CS AT NN IN NN BEZ VBG WDT PPSS BER RB VBG CS RB CD NN IN NN , PPSS MD VB CS AT NN IN JJ NN NN MD BE QL JJ . .
indeed , that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business , followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption .	RB , CS PPS MD BE VBN IN AT NN IN AT JJ JJ VBG CC NN NNS IN AT NN , VBN IN AT NN IN DT NN IN NNS IN JJ NN IN NN IN NN .
In fact , however , the problem is not so simple .	IN NN , RB , AT NN BEZ * QL JJ .
For a statement of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output ( or consumption ) of energy .	CS AT NN IN NNS IN NN MD VB AT NN CS AP IN DTS NNS BER * AT NN IN NN NN ( CC NN ) IN NN .
A recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required .	AT NN IN JJ NN NNS BEZ RB VBN .
The simplest division , and the one most frequently used ( with subdivisions ) in gas and electric rate cases , is a threefold division of the total operating and capital costs into `` customer costs '' , `` energy '' or `` volumetric costs '' , and `` demand '' or `` capacity '' costs .	AT JJT NN , CC AT CD QL RB VBN ( IN NNS ) IN NN CC NN NN NNS , BEZ AT JJ NN IN AT JJ VBG CC NN NNS IN `` NN NNS '' , `` NN '' CC `` JJ NNS '' , CC `` NN '' CC `` NN '' NNS .
If this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart in the actual rates of charge for service , as it actually does have in some rates , there would result a three-part rate for any one class of service .	CS DT JJ NN IN NNS BED TO HV PP$ NN IN AT JJ NNS IN NN IN NN , CS PPS RB DOZ HV IN DTI NNS , EX MD VB AT JJ NN IN DTI CD NN IN NN .
For example , the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge , a $5 charge for 250 kilowatt-hours of energy at	IN NN , AT JJ NN IN AT JJ NN MD BE AT NN IN AT NN NN NN , AT NN NN IN CD NNS IN NN IN
per kilowatt-hour , and a $2 charge for a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month at the rate of $1 per kilowatt -- a total bill of $8 for that month .	IN NN , CC AT NN NN IN AT JJ NN IN CD NNS IN AT NN IN AT NN IN NN IN NN -- AT JJ NN IN NNS IN DT NN .
But our present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service , and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs .	CC PP$ JJ NN VBZ IN AT NN IN NNS IN NN , CC RB RB IN NNS WPS MD CC MD * BE VBN TO VB DTS NNS .
Let us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn , recognizing that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative purposes ; ;	VB PPO RB VB DT IN AT CD NNS IN NN IN NN , VBG CS DT VBN NN BEZ VBN RB IN JJ NNS . .
costs actually vary in much more complex ways .	NNS RB VB IN QL QL JJ NNS .

The customer costs	AT-HL NN-HL NNS-HL
These are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless , or almost regardless , of power consumption .	DTS BER DTS VBG CC NN NNS VBN TO VB IN NN IN NNS RB , CC RB RB , IN NN NN .
Included as a minimum are the costs of metering and billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in taking on another consumer .	VBN CS AT NN BER AT NNS IN VBG CC NN RB IN WDT AP NNS AT NN MD VB IN VBG RP DT NN .
These minimum costs may come to $1 per month , more or less , for residential and small commercial customers , although they are substantially higher for large industrial users , who require more costly connections and metering devices .	DTS JJ NNS MD VB IN NN IN NN , AP CC AP , IN JJ CC JJ JJ NNS , CS PPSS BER QL JJR IN JJ JJ NNS , WPS VB QL JJ NNS CC VBG NNS .
While costs on this order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial rates , in the form of a mere `` service charge '' , they are more frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further payment .

But the really controversial aspect of customer-cost imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice of including , not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary ( low-voltage ) distribution system -- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity .

Indeed , we should say , on the contrary , that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the animal's pain , that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not .

The first argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference .	AT OD NN BEZ RB AT JJ NN IN WDT PPSS VB AT NN IN NN .

If anyone asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all , we should say that it made all the difference in the world , that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our assertion was in that case mistaken .

I come now to a third argument , which again is very simple .	PPSS VB RB IN AT OD NN , WDT RB BEZ QL JJ .
When we come upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; ;	WRB PPSS VB IN AT NN CC VB PP$ NN IN PP$ VBG BEG AT JJ NN , PPSS RB VB PPO IN DTI NN . .
the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling .	AT NNS BER QL JJ IN VBG CS JJ NNS DO RB VB VBG .
But suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again .	CC VB CS AT NN RBR PPSS VB IN AT NN IN NN CC VB PP$ NN RB .

and we are now so fatigued in body and mind that feeling is , as we say , quite dead .	CC PPSS BER RB QL VBN IN NN CC NN CS VBG BEZ , CS PPSS VB , QL JJ .
In these circumstances , since what was expressed by the remark when first made is , on the theory before us , simply absent , the remark now expresses nothing .	IN DTS NNS , CS WDT BEDZ VBN IN AT NN WRB RB VBN BEZ , IN AT NN IN PPO , RB JJ , AT NN RB VBZ PN .
It is as empty as the word `` Hurrah '' would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it .	PPS BEZ QL JJ CS AT NN `` UH-NC '' MD BE WRB EX BEDZ AT NN IN PPO .
And this seems to me untrue .	CC DT VBZ IN PPO JJ .
When we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing , the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing point , but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before , we should certainly answer Yes .

We all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not ; ;	PPSS ABN VB CS IN NNS CC NNS IN AT AP NN CD NN BEZ VBG CC DT * . .

Psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence .

This circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever .

Therefore , if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary .

Obviously , a satisfactory answer to the third question is imperative , if the argument is to get under way at all , for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital lesion , any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of course , as evidence to establish the desired conclusion .

( 2 ) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade .	( CD ) AT NN VBD AT JJ NN IN AT JJ NN .
Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line of work , that of a portfolio-maker , an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well-developed sense of form and contour .

It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision .

And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more than the foregoing facts ( mentioned above under 1 ) , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; ;	CC RB AT NNS VB : `` AT NN IN AT NN IN PP$ JJ NN CC IN PP$ NN , RB AP CS AT VBG NNS ( VBN RB IN CD ) , VB RB AT NN IN NN CS AT NN IN NN , IN AT JJ NN IN AT NN , BEDZ JJ . .

In what ways , then , did the patient's psychical blindness manifest itself ? ?	IN WDT NNS , RB , DOD AT NN$ JJ NN VB PPL . .
He could not see objects as unified , self-contained , and organized figures , as a person does with normal vision .	PPS MD * VB NNS CS VBN , JJ , CC VBN NNS , CS AT NN DOZ IN JJ NN .
The meaning of this , as we shall see , is that he had no fund of visual memory-images of objects as objects ; ;	AT NN IN DT , CS PPSS MD VB , BEZ CS PPS HVD AT NN IN JJ NNS IN NNS CS NNS . .
and , therefore , he could not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again .	CC , RB , PPS MD * VB RB JJ NNS IN VBG PPO RB .
Instead , he constantly became lost in parts and components of them , confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects , and so on , unless he allowed time to `` trace '' the object in question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours .

According to his own testimony , he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blots '' of color of a more or less indefinite size ; ;	IN IN PP$ JJ NN , PPS RB RB VBD NNS CS VBN CC RB CS RB JJ `` NNS '' IN NN IN AT QL CC QL JJ NN . .
at their edges they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether .	IN PP$ NNS PPSS VBD QL RB RP IN NN RB .

This meant , concretely , that the patient could not read at all without making writing-like movements of the head or body , became easily confused by `` hasher marks '' inserted between hand-written words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters , and could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing it .

and this he could do only by going over its mass with the tracing procedure .	CC DT PPS MD DO RB IN VBG IN PP$ NN IN AT VBG NN .

As one would surmise , the procedure , however , could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape , which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference .

If the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense of touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations , at least in regard to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied by the authors .

The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree .	AT JJ JJ NN WDT HVD VBN IN AT OD NN BEDZ RB VBN IN AT JJ NN .

Beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines .	IN AT JJ CC JJ NNS IN DT NN PPSS MD VB AT NN IN NN NN IN JJR NNS .
In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos .	IN JJR NNS NNS HVD HVN AP TO DO IN VBG AT JJ NN IN NN IN NN .

Wavy lines , feather-like patterns , rosettes of indefinitely floral nature , birds either singly or in stylized rows , animals in solemn frieze bands ( see Plates 11 - 12 ) -- all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze .

With respect to this view , two points are worth making .	IN NN IN DT NN , CD NNS BER JJ VBG .

Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself .

instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture .	RB IN VBG NNS IN NN , PPS VBZ PN AP CS -- AT NN .
Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances .

To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ;	TO VB , CC RB TO VB , AT VBN NN , NP CC NP VBD TO VB NN CC AP JJ NNS IN PP$ NN . .
the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas .	AT JJ NN RB VBD RB VBD NN IN AT NN IN AT NN CC BEDZ JJ IN QL JJR NNS .
In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing .	IN AP AP NNS , RB , NP VBD TO VB NNS IN JJ NN IN NN NN CC VBG .
These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ;	DTS NNS , IN NN IN PP$ JJ NN IN NN , VBD AT JJ NN IN QL JJ CC JJ NN CS AT VBG NN VBD AT VBN NN IN AT NN IN WDT PPS MD BE VBN -- CC VBN IN VBG RB -- RB IN JJ NN . .
that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface .	DT BEZ , IN BEG VBN IN JJ NN IN AT NNS VBN IN AT NN CS DTS NNS VBD AT NN IN AT NN RB IN AT NN .
The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth .	AT NN IN JJ NNS , RB , RB HVD AT NN IN VBG , RB CS VBG , NN CC NN .

It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint .

But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography ; ;	CC PPS BEZ RB JJ CS NP BEDZ AT JJ NN IN AT NN IN VBN NNS QL RB CS IN NN . .

But here again , the surface-declaring device both overshoots and falls short of its aim .	CC RB RB , AT JJ NN ABX VBZ CC VBZ RB IN PP$ NN .
For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief , which gives way in turn , and with equal immediacy , to an illusion that seems to contain both -- or neither .

Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it , the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it , and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as well as start his picture .

In their very first collages , Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real , bas-relief space -- or to be about to do so -- while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in , or flat upon , the surface .

Yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper , and the only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering , manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not `` jump '' .

At the same time , the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them , and by their placing in relation to the block capitals ; ;	IN AT AP NN , AT NN NNS PPLS VB TO BE VBN IN NN IN AT NNS CC NNS IN VBG VBN IN PPO , CC IN PP$ NN IN NN IN AT NN NNS . .

Depicted , Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal , undepicted kind , but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind -- and it does so , moreover , without depriving the latter of its literalness ; ;	VBN , JJ-TL NN BEZ RB QL RB VBN IN AT JJ , JJ NN , CC IN AT AP NN PPS VBZ IN CC RB VBZ AT JJ NN -- CC PPS DOZ RB , RB , IN VBG AT AP IN PP$ NN . .

they had also had to generalize it -- to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself .

It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation .	PPS BEDZ RB CS NP CC NP BED VBN IN AT JJ NN : PPSS HVD TO VB IN NN CC NN .

When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce -- become `` synthesized '' -- into larger planar shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane .

It was because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason -- that is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape -- that the identity of depicted objects , or at least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque's and Picasso's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there -- but only as flattened silhouettes -- than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 .

Three examples follow .	CD NNS VB .
Fromm's analysis of alienation in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the bureaucratization of the corporation , the separation of ownership from control , and the broad ( and thus from the point of view of corporate control , ineffective ) dispersion of stock ownership .

The broad conclusions of that pioneering work remain undisturbed , but subsequent research has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support , has suggested important revisions in the general analytic frame of reference , and has sharpened the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area .

Fromm seems unaware of these developments .	NP VBZ JJ IN DTS NNS .
Another example is his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from surveys designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of topics : he cites such survey-type findings just three times .	DT NN BEZ PP$ QL JJ NN IN AT JJ NN IN NN IN NNS VBN TO VB WDT CC WRB NNS RB DO VB CC VB IN AT JJ NN IN NNS : PPS VBZ JJ JJ NNS RB CD NNS .
Moreover , the conclusions he draws from the findings are not always the only ones possible .	RB , AT NNS PPS VBZ IN AT NNS BER * RB AT AP NNS JJ .
For example , he cites the following data from two studies on job satisfaction : in the first study , 85 per cent of professionals and executives , 64 per cent of white collar people , and 41 per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with their jobs ; ;	IN NN , PPS VBZ AT VBG NN IN CD NNS IN NN NN : IN AT OD NN , CD IN NN IN NNS CC NNS , CD IN NN IN JJ NN NNS , CC CD IN NN IN NN NNS VBD NN IN PP$ NNS . .
in the second study , the percentages were 86 for professionals , 74 for managerial persons , 42 for commercial employees , 56 for skilled workers , and 48 for semi-skilled workers .	IN AT OD NN , AT NNS BED CD IN NNS , CD IN JJ NNS , CD IN JJ NNS , CD IN JJ NNS , CC CD IN JJ NNS .
He concludes that these data show a `` remarkably high '' percentage of consciously dissatisfied and unhappy persons among factory and clerical workers .	PPS VBZ CS DTS NNS VB AT `` QL JJ '' NN IN RB VBN CC JJ NNS IN NN CC JJ NNS .
Starting from other value premises than Fromm's , some analysts might conclude that the percentages really tell us very little at all , while others might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low .

What matters is that while Fromm's reading of the data is not the only one possible , it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfied .	WDT NNS BEZ CS CS NP$ NN IN AT NNS BEZ * AT AP CD JJ , PPS BEZ RB AT CD PPSS MD VB IN AT NN WPS RB VBZ CS AT NN MD CC MD TO BE JJ CC VBN .
Fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation in 1945 , in which 49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much as he could in a day's work , while 41 per cent said he should not do his best but should turn out only the average amount .

Fromm says these data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread .	NP VBZ DTS NNS VB DT NN NN CC NN BER JJ .
That is one way to read the findings , but again there are other ways .	DT BEZ CD NN TO VB AT NNS , CC RB EX BER AP NNS .
One might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary associations in the factory , an interpretation which would run counter to Fromm's theory of alienation .	PN MD VB JJ NNS TO VB AT NN IN JJ JJ NNS IN AT NN , AT NN WDT MD VB RB IN NP$ NN IN NN .
Or , he might remind Fromm that the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly low : after all , the medieval guild system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount ; ;	CC , PPS MD VB NP CS AT CD IN NN NN BEZ RB QL JJ : IN ABN , AT JJ NN NN BEDZ VBN IN AT NN CS CD IN NN IN AT NNS MD TO VB RP RB AT JJ NN . .
and today's trade unions announce pretty much the same view .	CC NR$ NN NNS VB QL RB AT AP NN .
In view of these shortcomings in both the amount and the interpretation of survey-type findings on public opinion , and considering the criticisms which can be brought against Fromm's philosophical anthropology , such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously .

The ambiguities suggested above stem from a more basic difficulty in Fromm's style of thought .	AT NNS VBN RB VB IN AT QL JJ NN IN NP$ NN IN NN .
He seems to use the term alienation in two different ways .	PPS VBZ TO VB AT NN NN-NC IN CD JJ NNS .
Sometimes he uses it as a subjective , descriptive term , and sometimes as an objective , diagnostic one .	RB PPS VBZ PPO CS AT JJ , JJ NN , CC RB CS AT JJ , JJ CD .
That is , sometimes it is used to describe felt human misery , and other times it is postulated to explain unfelt anxiety and discontent .	DT BEZ , RB PPS BEZ VBN TO VB VBN JJ NN , CC AP NNS PPS BEZ VBN TO VB JJ NN CC NN .
The failure to keep these two usages distinct presents hazards to the reader .	AT NN TO VB DTS CD NNS JJ VBZ NNS IN AT NN .
It also permits Fromm to do some dubious things with empirical findings .	PPS RB VBZ NP TO DO DTI JJ NNS IN JJ NNS .
When alienation is used as an objective and diagnostic category , for example , it becomes clear that Fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far toward conquering it .	WRB NN BEZ VBN CS AT JJ CC JJ NN , IN NN , PPS VBZ JJ CS NP MD HV TO VB DT NN IN NN VBZ RB IN VBG PPO .
( He , in effect , does say this in his discussion of the pseudo-happiness of the automaton conformist .	( PPS , IN NN , DOZ VB DT IN PP$ NN IN AT NN IN AT NN NN .
) Starting from this , and accepting his estimate of the iniquities of modern society , it would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would be that of a work-satisfaction survey which reported widespread , stated worker satisfaction , rather than widespread , stated worker dissatisfaction .	) VBG IN DT , CC VBG PP$ NN IN AT NNS IN JJ NN , PPS MD VB CS AT QL JJ NN IN NN MD BE CS IN AT NN NN WDT VBD JJ , VBN NN NN , RB CS JJ , VBN NN NN .
The point is that in a system such as Fromm's which recognizes unconscious motivations , and which rests on certain ethical absolutes , empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition the writer is urging at the moment .	AT NN BEZ CS IN AT NN JJ CS NP$ WDT VBZ JJ NNS , CC WDT VBZ IN AP JJ NNS , JJ NNS MD BE VBN TO VB WDT NN AT NN BEZ VBG IN AT NN .
Thus , in the example cited above Fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the workers are being deprived unconsciously , unknowingly , of fulfillment , and then supports this with survey data reporting conscious , experienced frustrations .	RB , IN AT NN VBN RB NP VBZ PP$ JJ NN IN AT NN CS AT NNS BER BEG VBN RB , RB , IN NN , CC RB VBZ DT IN NN NNS VBG JJ , VBN NNS .
He has his cake and eats it too : if the workers say they are dissatisfied , this shows conscious alienation ; ;	PPS HVZ PP$ NN CC VBZ PPO RB : CS AT NNS VB PPSS BER VBN , DT VBZ JJ NN . .
if they say they are satisfied , this shows unconscious alienation .	CS PPSS VB PPSS BER VBN , DT VBZ JJ NN .

The final example of the failure to use available evidence , though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered , comes from Fromm's treatment of some other writers who have dealt with the same themes .

the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not despise us : it only neglects us '' ( Early Life , p. 63 ) .

About a quarter of Hardy's poems carry an appended date line , usually the year of completion , but sometimes inclusive years ( `` 1908 - 1910 '' ) or two separate dates when Hardy worked on the poem ( `` 1905 and 1926 '' ) or an approximate date ( `` During the War '' ) .

He had two productive periods , one in the late 1860's , the other in the decade from 1910 to 1920 ( half of the dated poems are from the latter period , and these alone total about one-tenth of all Hardy's poems ) .

The first productive period came when he was considering poetry as a vocation , before he had decided to write fiction for a living ( in his note for Who's Who he wrote that he `` wrote verses 1865 - 1868 ; ;	AT OD JJ NN VBD WRB PPS BEDZ VBG NN CS AT NN , CS PPS HVD VBN TO VB NN IN AT NN ( IN PP$ NN IN WPS+BEZ-TL WPS-TL PPS VBD CS PPS `` VBD NNS CD IN CD . .

During the poetically sterile years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was , in addition , burdened with bad health ( he spent six months in bed in 1881 , too ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at A Laodicean ) .

There are more poems dated in the 1890's than in the '80's -- Hardy had apparently resumed the viewless wings as he decreased the volume of his fiction -- but none in 1891 , the year of Tess , and only one in 1895 , the year of Jude .

The second productive period , the decade from 1910 to 1920 , can be related to three events : the completion of The Dynasts in 1909 , which left Hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years ; ;	AT OD JJ NN , AT NN IN CD IN CD , MD BE VBN IN CD NNS : AT NN IN AT-TL NNS-TL IN CD , WDT VBD NP JJ IN NN IN AT OD NN IN CD NNS . .

It may seem strange that a poet should come to full fruition in his seventies , but we have it on Hardy's own authority that `` he was a child till he was sixteen , a youth till he was five-and-twenty , and a young man till he was nearly fifty '' ( Early Life , p. 42 ) .

`` Neutral Tones '' we immediately recognize as a fine poem in Hardy's most characteristic style : the plain but not quite colloquial language , the hard , particular , colorless images , the slightly odd stanza-form , the dramatic handling of the occasion , the refusal to resolve the issue -- all these we have seen in Hardy's best poems .	`` JJ-TL NNS-TL '' PPSS RB VB CS AT JJ NN IN NP$ QL JJ NN : AT JJ CC * QL JJ NN , AT JJ , JJ , JJ NNS , AT QL JJ NN , AT JJ NN IN AT NN , AT NN TO VB AT NN -- ABN DTS PPSS HV VBN IN NP$ JJT NNS .

The sewage system from Kansas City was not expected to serve the Red Bridge area for several years .	AT NN NN IN NP-TL NN-TL BEDZ * VBN TO VB AT JJ-TL NN-TL NN IN AP NNS .
This necessitated the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 Aj .	DT VBD AT NN IN JJ NN NN NNS IN AT VBN NN IN CD IN CD NN .
For the initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in Figure 1 .	IN AT JJ NN AT NN NN BEDZ VBN CS VBN IN NN-TL CD-TL .
The oxidation pond has a surface area of 4.77 acres and a depth of 4 Aj .	AT NN NN HVZ AT NN NN IN CD NNS CC AT NN IN CD NN .

In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors .	IN AT NN IN CD AT NN NN VBD RB JJ CC VBD JJ NNS .
It was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the pond by regular additions of sodium nitrate until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from blue-green to green algae .	PPS BEDZ JJ TO VB JJ NNS IN AT NN IN JJ NNS IN NN NN CS AT NN VBD CC AT NNS NN VBD IN JJ IN JJ NNS .
The anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium nitrate .	AT JJ NNS IN AT VBG NN NN VBD NN IN AP NNS IN VBG JJ NN CS IN NN NN .
At the same time further expansion in the Red Bridge Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities .	IN AT AP NN JJR NN IN AT JJ-TL NN-TL NN-TL VBD AT NN IN JJ NN NN NNS .
The large land areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer .	AT JJ NN NNS VBN IN NN NNS VBD DT NN IN NN RB JJ IN AT NN .
It was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development .	PPS BEDZ VBN CS VBN NNS BE VBN TO VB AT NN IN AT VBG NN NNS CC TO VB AT JJ NN IN AT JJ NN .

The major contributor was a shopping center with houses being added to the system as the subdivision developed .	AT JJ NN BEDZ AT VBG NN IN NNS BEG VBN IN AT NN CS AT NN VBD .
The pilot lagoon was designed to handle the wastes from 314 persons with a 4-day aeration period .	AT NN NN BEDZ VBN TO VB AT NNS IN CD NNS IN AT JJ NN NN .
Initially , the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18-month period .	RB , AT NN MD BE RB IN AT VBG NN IN AT JJ NN IN AT NNS VBG IN AT JJ NN .

The pilot plant was equipped with a 3-hp. turbine aerator ( Figure 2 ) .	AT NN NN BEDZ VBN IN AT JJ NN NN ( NN-TL CD-TL ) .
The aerator had a variable-speed drive to permit operation through a range of speeds .	AT NN HVD AT NN NN TO VB NN IN AT NN IN NNS .
The sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and continuously recorded on 24-hr. charts .	AT NN NN IN AT NN NN BEDZ VBN CC RB VBN IN JJ NNS .
The raw sewage was introduced directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank contents .	AT JJ NN BEDZ VBN RB IN AT NN NN TO VB JJ NN IN AT JJ NN IN AT NN NN NNS .

Ice caused the aerator to overload , straining the drive belts .	NN VBD AT NN TO VB , VBG AT NN NNS .
The slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage .	AT NN IN AT NN NNS VBD AT NN TO VB RP CC VB NN NN QL RB CS AT NN IN AT JJ NN .

It seems that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system .	PPS VBZ CS AT VBN NN BEDZ AT QL RB VBN NN NN CC AT RB VBN VBN NN NN .
The flow rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in Table 1 .	AT NN NN VBD QL JJ IN AT NN NNS CS VBN IN NN-TL CD-TL .

The large amount of vegetable grindings from the grocery store in the shopping center created a suspended solids problem .	AT JJ NN IN NN NNS IN AT NN NN IN AT VBG NN VBD AT VBN NNS NN .
The vegetables were not readily metabolized by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to float on the surface .	AT NNS BED * RB VBN IN AT NNS IN AT NN NN CC VBD TO VB IN AT NN .
A skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of most of these light solids .	AT VBG NN IN AT NN NN VBD NN IN AP IN DTS JJ NNS .

The increase in oxygen uptake rates from 1.2 to 2.6 mg/l/hr which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to be related to resuspension of solids which had settled at the lower rotor speeds .

That which follows will be a discussion of principles and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare .	DT WDT VBZ MD BE AT NN IN NNS CC JJ NN IN AT JJ NN IN JJ NN .
Russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world , divided between her various fleets .	NP VBZ AT NN IN NNS IN AT NN , VBN IN PP$ AP NNS .
Some are also in Albania and others are on loan to Egypt .	DTI BER RB IN NP CC NNS BER IN NN IN NP .
Other countries which may willingly or unwillingly become Communist can furnish bases .	AP NNS WDT MD RB CC RB VB JJ MD VB NNS .
Communist target areas can be assumed , but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide with Soviet intentions .	JJ NN NNS MD BE VBN , CC EX BEZ AT NN CS JJ NNS VB IN NP NNS .
Attack can come from almost any direction against many locations .	NN MD VB IN RB DTI NN IN AP NNS .
Logically , then , the first principle of the plan must be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area .	RB , RB , AT OD NN IN AT NN MD BE CS PPS BEZ * RB VBN IN DTI JJ NN .
It is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while building , at bases , in transit , and on station .	PPS BEZ RB VBN CS AT NN MD BE VBN CS VBG , IN NNS , IN NN , CC IN NN .

In transit or on station , it may not be possible to attack the submarines until commission of an overt act .	IN NN CC IN NN , PPS MD * BE JJ TO VB AT NNS CS NN IN AT JJ NN .
The Communists are adept at utilizing hostilities short of general war and will do so whenever it is to their advantage .	AT NNS-TL BER JJ IN VBG NNS JJ IN JJ NN CC MD DO RB WRB PPS BEZ IN PP$ NN .
Therefore the second principle of the plan must be that , while providing for all-out hostilities , its effectiveness is not dependent on general war .	RB AT OD NN IN AT NN MD BE CS , CS VBG IN JJ NNS , PP$ NN BEZ * JJ IN JJ NN .
Antisubmarine warfare does not involve clashes between large opposing forces , with the decision a result of a single battle .	JJ NN DOZ * VB NNS IN JJ VBG NNS , IN AT NN AT NN IN AT AP NN .
It is a war of attrition , of single actions , of an exchange of losses .	PPS BEZ AT NN IN NN , IN AP NNS , IN AT NN IN NNS .
This exchange must result in our ending up with some effective units .	DT NN MD VB IN PP$ VBG RP IN DTI JJ NNS .

RB , HVG AP NNS IN DTI NNS -- RB NNS -- CS AT NN , PP$ NNS VB TO BE QL JJR CS PP$$ , CS CS AT NN MD BE IN PP$ NN .

The submarine has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since World War 2 .	AT NN HVZ VBN PP$ NN IN AP NNS IN NN IN NN-TL NN-TL CD-TL .

As detection ranges increase , weapons will be developed to attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges .	CS NN NNS VB , NNS MD BE VBN TO VB AP NNS CC NN NN IN DTS NNS .

Some limitations of one element can be compensated for by a capability of another .	DTI NNS IN CD NN MD BE VBN IN IN AT NN IN DT .
Elements used in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum of the capabilities of the individual elements .	NNS VBN IN NN MD VB AT JJ NN RBR CS AT NN IN AT NNS IN AT AP NNS .

IN DT NN AT NN IN AT JJ NN IN JJ NN HVZ BEN VBN , AT NN HVZ BEN VBN , JJ NNS VBG PP$ NN VBN RP , CC AT VBG NNS VBN .
Before considering these elements in more detail , an additional requirement should be stated .	CS VBG DTS NNS IN AP NN , AT JJ NN MD BE VBN .
Large area coverage will accomplish all other tasks .	JJ NN NN MD VB ABN AP NNS .
Therefore , because reduction in tasks results in reduction of forces required , the plan should provide for expanding area coverage .	RB , CS NN IN NNS NNS IN NN IN NNS VBN , AT NN MD VB IN VBG NN NN .
But it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented geographically .	CC PPS MD BE VBN CS AT NN MD * BE VBN RB .
Consequently , the system giving area coverage ( if such coverage is less than world wide ) must be flexible and hence at least partially mobile .	RB , AT NN VBG NN NN ( CS JJ NN BEZ AP CS NN JJ ) MD BE JJ CC RB IN AP RB JJ .
Since effective area coverage appears fairly remote , the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements : air , surface , sub-surface , fixed installations , mines , and intelligence .

Intelligence , as used herein , will include information on possible opponents and on the environment which can affect operations .	NN , CS VBN RB , MD VB NN IN JJ NNS CC IN AT NN WDT MD VB NNS .
These can be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence .	DTS MD BE VBN IN CS JJ NN CC JJ NN .
In submarine defense these must have maximum stress .	IN JJ NN DTS MD HV JJ NN .
Good operational intelligence can ensure sound planning , greatly reduce force requirements , and increase tactical effectiveness .	JJ JJ NN MD VB JJ NN , RB VB NN NNS , CC VB JJ NN .
Environmental intelligence is just as important .	JJ NN BEZ RB QL JJ .
The ocean presently co-operates with the target .	AT NN RB VBZ IN AT NN .
Full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the environment to our side , resulting in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactics , a decrease in enemy capabilities , and the development of methods of capitalizing on the environment .	JJ NN IN AT NN IN NN MD VB AT NN IN PP$ NN , VBG IN AT NN IN NN IN NN CC NNS , AT NN IN NN NNS , CC AT NN IN NNS IN VBG IN AT NN .
Therefore , improved intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and , as it supports all other elements , rates a top priority .	RB , VBN NN MD VB IN VBN NN NNS CC , CS PPS VBZ ABN AP NNS , VBZ AT JJS NN .
Gathering intelligence is important , but of equal importance is its translation into usable form .	VBG NN BEZ JJ , CC IN JJ NN BEZ PP$ NN IN JJ NN .
A program is needed to translate the results of oceanographic research into tactical and operating instructions .	AT NN BEZ VBN TO VB AT NNS IN JJ NN IN JJ CC VBG NNS .
Approaching this problem on a statistical basis is invalid , because the opponent has the same sources available and will be encountered not under average conditions , but under the conditions most advantageous to him .	VBG DT NN IN AT JJ NN BEZ JJ , CS AT NN HVZ AT AP NNS JJ CC MD BE VBN * IN JJ NNS , CC IN AT NNS QL JJ IN PPO .
Therefore , the on-the-scene commander must have detailed operating instructions based on measurement of conditions , in the area , at the time of encounter .	RB , AT JJ NN MD HV VBN VBG NNS VBN IN NN IN NNS , IN AT NN , IN AT NN IN NN .
All capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then .	ABN NNS MD BE VBN IN JJ NN RB .
Temperature , wind , oxygen content , depth , bottom character , and animal life are the chief environmental variables .	NN , NN , NN NN , NN , NN NN , CC NN NN BER AT JJS JJ NNS .

Variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature , because more of the variables would be encompassed .	NNS IN NN NN MD BE VBN RB CS NN , CS AP IN AT NNS MD BE VBN .
These variations must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically .	DTS NNS MD RB BE VBN RB QL RB CS RB .

Mine warfare has in the past been directed against surface targets .	NN NN HVZ IN AT NN BEN VBN IN NN NNS .
By its nature it has always been of great psychological advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater counter-efforts .	IN PP$ NN PPS HVZ RB BEN IN JJ JJ NN CC JJ NNS HV VBN QL JJR NNS .
Mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets .	NNS BER BEG RB VBN IN JJ NNS .
They are still considered to be for use in restricted waters , however , and targets must come within a few yards of them .	PPSS BER RB VBN TO BE IN NN IN VBN NNS , RB , CC NNS MD VB IN AT AP NNS IN PPO .
Mines need to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine warfare employment , extended to deep water , and have their effective area per unit increased .	NNS VB TO BE VBN CS AT JJ NN IN JJ NN NN , VBN IN JJ NN , CC HV PP$ JJ NN IN NN VBN .

they are difficult to counter , cost little to maintain until required , and can be put into place quickly .	PPSS BER JJ TO VB , VB AP TO VB CS VBN , CC MD BE VBN IN NN RB .
A most attractive feature is that detection and attack are combined in a single package .	AT QL JJ NN BEZ CS NN CC NN BER VBN IN AT AP NN .
Effective employment will reduce force requirements .	JJ NN MD VB NN NNS .

Systems which detect submarines over wide areas are attractive , although they can be only `` burglar alarms '' .	NNS WDT VB NNS IN JJ NNS BER JJ , CS PPSS MD BE AP `` NN NNS '' .
Mobile forces are required to localize and attack detected targets , since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target .	JJ NNS BER VBN TO VB CC VB VBN NNS , CS AT NNS BER * JJ IN VBG AT NN .
Such systems are expensive and are oriented geographically .	JJ NNS BER JJ CC BER VBN RB .
In an over-all ASW concept , dependence on and effort expended for such systems should be limited to those with proven capabilities .	IN AT JJ NN NN , NN IN CC NN VBN IN JJ NNS MD BE VBN IN DTS IN VBN NNS .
No general installation should be made until a model installation has been proved and its maximum capability determined .	AT JJ NN MD BE VBN CS AT NN NN HVZ BEN VBN CC PP$ JJ NN VBN .

The preparation of such products is not new , but the systems heretofore employed in polymerizations have commanded considerable experimental skill and starting materials of a high purity .	AT NN IN JJ NNS BEZ * JJ , CC AT NNS RB VBN IN NNS HV VBN JJ JJ NN CC VBG NNS IN AT JJ NN .
In the new process impurities present in the solvent ( benzene ) , the monomer , and in the reaction system which would cause deactivation of propagation centers , are rendered inactive prior to polymerization by gradual addition of initiator , a mixture of butyl-lithium and telomeric styryl-lithium , at a temperature low enough to suppress chain growth .

Upon completion of the purging step , additional initiator appropriate for the molecular weight of the sample desired is added , and the system is then warmed to the polymerization temperature , at which the reaction is allowed to go to completion .

Enzymatic action in stored food produces changes which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability .	JJ NN IN VBN NN VBZ NNS WDT MD RB VB AT NN IN NN CC PP$ NN .
Spoilage by chemical action results from the reaction of one group of components in the food with others or with its environment , as in corrosion of the walls of metal containers or the reaction of fats with oxygen in the air to produce rancidity .

To permit the storage of food for long periods of time , a method of preservation must accomplish the destruction of microorganisms and inhibition of enzymatic action .	TO VB AT NN IN NN IN JJ NNS IN NN , AT NN IN NN MD VB AT NN IN NNS CC NN IN JJ NN .
The term `` sterilization '' applies to methods involving essentially complete destruction of all microorganisms .	AT NN `` NN-NC '' VBZ IN NNS VBG QL JJ NN IN ABN NNS .

General effects of ionizing radiation	JJ-HL NNS-HL IN-HL VBG-HL NN-HL
Ionizing radiation can cause the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage or , at lower doses , can inhibit their action .	VBG NN MD VB AT NN IN NNS CC NNS VBN IN NN NN CC , IN JJR NNS , MD VB PP$ NN .
It furnishes a means of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain parasitic organisms present in meats .	PPS VBZ AT NN IN VBG NNS IN VBN NN NNS QL RB CS AP JJ NNS RB IN NNS .
Deactivation of enzymes is also possible , although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 Mrad or more .	NN IN NNS BEZ RB JJ , CS DTI NNS VB QL JJ NNS IN CD NN CC AP .
Because of undesirable flavors , odors , colors , and generally low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude , the inactivation of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation by the conventional heat-processing methods of blanching .

Preserving foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side effects , particularly at the higher radiation dosages .	VBG NNS IN VBG NN VBZ IN DTI JJ NN NNS , RB IN AT JJR NN NNS .
In this respect , the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized foods has , to date , been found to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially processed foods .	IN DT NN , AT JJ NN CC JJ NN IN AP VBN NNS HVZ , TO VB , BEN VBN TO BE JJ IN NN IN JJ CC RB VBN NNS .

Radiation sources	NN-HL NNS-HL
For irradiation of food , the results obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation , and X-ray , gamma , and high-energy electron radiation are suitable .	IN NN IN NN , AT NNS VBN VB IN AT NN RB CS AT JJ NN IN NN , CC NN-TL , NN , CC NN NN NN BER JJ .
Aside from availability and economic considerations , each has certain practical advantages ; ;	RB IN NN CC JJ NNS , DT HVZ AP JJ NNS . .

Of the potentially useful sources of ionizing radiations , gamma sources , cobalt-60 , cesium-137 , fission products , or a reactor irradiation loop system using a material such as an indium salt have received most attention for food-preservation systems .

Because agricultural activities are seasonal and the areas of production and harvest of many foods are widely scattered geographically , and because of the high cost of transporting bulk food items any substantial distance to a central processing location , the use of large central processing stations , where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the megawatt range might be utilized , is inherently impracticable .

If a wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate by an instrument like the Hesiometer with a knife of constant rake angle , a number of removal mechanisms are often observed which depend upon the thickness of the coating .

Blunt knife	JJ-HL NN-HL
One of these is the fact that the knife employed , no matter how well sharpened , will have a slightly rounded cutting edge .	CD IN DTS BEZ AT NN CS AT NN VBN , AT NN WQL RB VBN , MD HV AT RB VBN VBG NN .
This signifies that **yc , the rake angle , is no longer a constant to zero film thickness .	DT VBZ CS NN , AT NN NN , BEZ QL RBR AT JJ IN CD NN NN .
The curvature of this bluntness is , in the case of the Carboloy knife employed in the Hesiometer , determined by the grain sizes of the polished grit and the tungsten carbide crystals cemented together in the knife body and is in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mil. .

The force vector concept of Fig. 6 can readily be applied to this condition also .	AT NN NN NN IN NN-TL CD-TL MD RB BE VBN IN DT NN RB .
Because the rake angle Af at the tip of the knife is very much smaller ( or even negative ) when compared to the value of **yc for the major portion of the knife , a very rapid increase in cutting force with thickness will result .

This reduces to the relationship : Af , where Af is the intercept at zero thickness of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn.

It can be seen that Af is a constant , and is determined for the most part by the geometry of the knife .	PPS MD BE VBN DT NN BEZ AT NN , CC BEZ VBN IN AT AP NN IN AT NN IN AT NN .
The blunter the knife , the higher is the value of Af .	AT JJR AT NN , AT JJR BEZ AT NN IN NN .
The importance of a hard , abrasion-resistant knife material like the Carboloy employed in the Hesiometer immediately becomes apparent .	AT NN IN AT JJ , JJ NN NN CS AT NP VBN IN AT NN-TL RB VBZ JJ .

Knife friction	NN-HL NN-HL
A second factor which enters into the practical measurement of the instrumentally determined cutting force is the frictional resistance caused by the bottom of the knife against the substrate .	AT OD NN WDT VBZ IN AT JJ NN IN AT RB VBN VBG NN BEZ AT JJ NN VBN IN AT NN IN AT NN IN AT NN .
This is not a constant value like Af , but varies with the thickness of the coating and the direction and magnitude of the resultants R and Af of Fig. 6 .	DT BEZ * AT JJ NN CS NN , CC VBZ IN AT NN IN AT NN CC AT NN CC NN IN AT NNS NN CC NN IN NN-TL CD-TL .
Under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust Af against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of Af .	IN NN NNS IN VBG AT NN VBZ AT NN NN IN AT NN WDT VBZ TO VB PPO IN AT NN CC VB PPO RB IN AT NN IN IN AT NN NN IN NN .
The resultant friction force , Af is thus directly proportional to Af and consequently also to film thickness .	AT JJ NN NN , NN BEZ RB RB JJ IN NN CC RB RB IN NN NN .
The value of Af can readily be assessed by determining the frictional force exerted on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track under various external loadings .	AT NN IN NN MD RB BE VBN IN VBG AT JJ NN VBN IN AT NN CS VBG IN AT RB VBN NN NN IN AP JJ NNS .
A straight line relationship is usually observed in a plot of Af against load L , having slope k , and Af .	AT JJ NN NN BEZ RB VBN IN AT NN IN NN IN NN NN , HVG NN NN , CC NN .
Since the load L , under actual cutting conditions is caused by Af , it can be seen that Af	CS AT NN NN , IN JJ VBG NNS BEZ VBN IN NN , PPS MD BE VBN DT NN

The measured force , H , in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates consequently can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the coating , Af , that due to the bluntness of the knife , Af , and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate , Af , or Af .

Chipping mechanism of cohesive failure	VBG NN IN JJ NN
Although a large number of coatings systems , particularly at low thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism , frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place .	CS AT JJ NN IN NNS NNS , RB IN JJ NNS VB RB IN AT VBG NN , RB AT OD NN IN JJ NN MD RB VB NN .

This is shown in the photomicrograph of Fig. 8 .	DT BEZ VBN IN AT NN IN NN-TL CD-TL .
The basic difference between the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without fracture , rupture intermittently occurs along the shear plane .

In the first picture ( 9a ) the knife is just beginning to advance into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip formation .	IN AT OD NN ( CD ) AT NN BEZ RB VBG TO VB IN AT VBN NN WDT BEDZ VBN IN AT AP NN NN .
In the next , the shear plane angle is high , and extends to the inclined work surface .	IN AT AP , AT NN NN NN BEZ JJ , CC VBZ IN AT VBN NN NN .
With increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly decreases .	IN VBG NN IN AT NN IN AT NN AT NN NN VBZ IN AT NNS NN CC AT NN NN RB VBZ .
Eventually , rupture occurs along the shear plane ( 9e ) , and the cycle repeats itself .	RB , NN VBZ IN AT NN NN ( CD ) , CC AT NN VBZ PPL .

Efficiency of fiber couplers	NN-HL IN-HL NN-HL NNS-HL
The efficiency of fiber optics plates depends on four factors : ( A )	AT NN IN NN NN NNS VBZ IN CD NNS : (-HL NP-HL )-HL

The numerical aperture of the fibers is given by : Af where Af .	AT JJ NN IN AT NNS BEZ VBN IN : NN WRB NN .
The angle Af is measured in the medium of index Af .	AT NN NN BEZ VBN IN AT NN IN NN NN .
Settled phosphors , as generally used in image intensifiers , have low optical contact with the substrate surface , hence Af shall be assumed .	VBN NNS , QL RB VBN IN NN NNS , HV JJ JJ NN IN AT NN NN , RB NN MD BE VBN .
The numerical aperture should be in general close to unity .	AT JJ NN MD BE IN JJ RB IN NN .
This condition can be satisfied , e.g. , with Af and Af or equivalent glass combinations .	DT NN MD BE VBN , RB , IN NN CC NN CC JJ NN NNS .
A sufficiently good approximation for determining the end reflection losses R can be obtained from the angle independent Fresnel formula : Af .	AT QL JJ NN IN VBG AT NN NN NNS NN MD BE VBN IN AT NN JJ NP NN : NN .
For phosphor to fiber and fiber to air surfaces , and assuming Af , we obtain Af percent .	IN NN IN NN CC NN IN NN NNS , CC VBG NN , PPSS VB NN NN .

Hence , the Af factor for the output fiber coupler is Af .	RB , AT NN NN IN AT NN NN NN BEZ NN .
As the index of refraction of photosensitive surfaces of the SbCs-type lies around 2 , the Fresnel losses at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0.5 percent and the Af factor for the interstage coupler is 0.95 .	CS AT NN IN NN IN JJ NNS IN AT NN VBZ IN CD , AT NP NNS IN AT NN NN BER RB CD NN CC AT NN NN IN AT JJ NN BEZ CD .
It might be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further .	PPS MD BE VBN CS JJ NNS MD VB NN NN NNS QL RBR .
The internal losses are due to absorption and the small but finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to deviations from the prescribed , cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute imperfections of the core-jacket interface .	AT JJ NNS BER JJ IN NN CC AT JJ CC JJ NNS VBN IN AT JJ JJ NNS JJ IN NNS IN AT VBN , JJ NN NN CC JJ NNS IN AT NN NN .
These losses depend on fiber diameter and length , absorption coefficient , the mean value of the loss per internal reflection and last , but not least , on the angular distribution of the incident light .

This relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber diameters increasing the number of internal reflections .	DT QL JJ NN BEZ RB JJ IN AT JJ NN NNS VBG AT NN IN JJ NNS .
Since we are considering here relatively small diameter ( 1 - 1.5 inches ) fiber plates , their average thickness can be kept below 1/4 inch and their internal losses may be assumed as 15 percent ( per plate ) .

resolution limitations in a single stage	NN-HL NNS-HL IN-HL AT-HL AP-HL NN-HL
The resolution limitations for a single stage are given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing screen .	AT NN NNS IN AT AP NN BER VBN IN AT JJ NN IN AT NN JJ NN QL RB CS AT NN NNS IN AT JJ VBG NN .
The resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations .	AT NN NNS IN AT JJ NN VB IN ABX AT NN IN NN CC JJ NNS .

The inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness ( with increasing anode voltage ) , decreases with decreasing porosity ( thus the advantage of cathodophoretic phosphor deposition ) and might be impaired by the normally used aluminum mirror .

the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter .	AT NN IN WDT AT NN IN NN VBZ IN AT VBG NNS IN AT JJS NNS IN NNS BEZ VBN IN AT AP NN .
The objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ;	AT JJ NN BEZ DTI NN IN AT NN IN NN IN AT NN IN VBG . .
it is the subject of Chapter 4 .	PPS BEZ AT NN IN NN-TL CD-TL .
The essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman .	AT JJ NN IN AT JJ NN WRB AT NN IN AT NN BEZ VBN IN AT NN IN NNS IN AT NN BEDZ RB VBN IN NP .
He recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process , the remaining stages must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage , if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process .

Moreover , by systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal Af-stage policy for the remaining stages , we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all R stages .	RB , IN RB VBG AT VBG NNS IN AT OD NN CC RB VBG AT JJ NN NN IN AT VBG NNS , PPSS MD RB VB AT JJ NN IN ABN NN NNS .
Proceeding in this way , from one to two and from two to three stages , we may gradually build up the policy for any number .	VBG IN DT NN , IN CD IN CD CC IN CD IN CD NNS , PPSS MD RB VB RP AT NN IN DTI NN .
At each step of the calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied .	IN DT NN IN AT NN AT VBG NNS IN RB CD NN MD BE VBN .
To see how important this economy is , let us suppose that there are M operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by N variables ; ;	TO VB WRB JJ DT NN BEZ , VB PPO VB CS EX BER NP VBG NNS IN DT NN CC CS AT NN BEZ VBN IN NP NNS . .
then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operations of order Af ( where a is some number not unreasonably large ) .	RB AT NN IN AT JJ IN DTI CD NN MD VB AT NN IN NNS IN NN NN ( WRB NN BEZ DTI NN * QL JJ ) .
To proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated to allow for interpolation ; ;	TO VB IN CD NN IN AT AP AT JJ NN IN NN NNS MD BE VBN TO VB IN NN . .
this number will be of the order of Af .	DT NN MD BE IN AT NN IN NN .
If , however , we are seeking the optimal R-stage policy for a given feed state , only one search for a maximum is required at the final step .	CS , RB , PPSS BER VBG AT JJ NN NN IN AT VBN NN NN , RB CD NN IN AT JJ BEZ VBN IN AT JJ NN .
Thus a number of operations of the order of Af are required .	RB AT NN IN NNS IN AT NN IN NN BER VBN .
If all the operating variables were varied simultaneously , Af operations would be required to do the same job , and as R increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program .	CS ABN AT VBG NNS BED VBN RB , NN NNS MD BE VBN TO DO AT AP NN , CC CS NN VBZ DT VBZ QL QL QL RB CS AT NN IN NNS VBN IN AT JJ NN .
But even more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy , namely , that for the given feed state and R stages .	CC QL QL JJ CS DT BEZ AT NN CS AT JJ NN IN RB VBG ABN VBG NNS HVZ VBN RB CD JJ NN , RB , DT IN AT VBN NN NN CC NN NNS .
In contrast , the dynamic program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for any smaller number of stages .	IN NN , AT JJ NN VBZ DT NN CC AT JJ NN IN NNS IN DTI JJR NN IN NNS .
If the problem is enlarged to require a complete coverage of feed states , Af operations are needed by the dynamic program and Af by the direct search .	CS AT NN BEZ VBN TO VB AT JJ NN IN NN NNS , NN NNS BER VBN IN AT JJ NN CC NN IN AT JJ NN .
But Af is vastly larger than R .	CC NN BEZ QL JJR CS NN .
No optimism is more baseless than that which believes that the high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the crudest of methods in searching out a result .	AT NN BEZ QL JJ CS DT WDT VBZ CS AT JJ NN IN JJ JJ NNS VBZ IN NN IN AT JJT IN NNS IN VBG RP AT NN .
Suppose that Af , and that the average operation requires only Af sec. .	VB CS NN , CC CS AT JJ NN VBZ RB NN NNS .
Then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three millennia ! !	RB AT JJ NN MD VB RB AT NN CS AT JJ NN MD VB AP IN CD NNS . .
The principle of optimality thus brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a multistage decision process .	AT NN IN NN RB VBZ AT JJ NN IN AT NN IN AT JJ NN IN AT NN NN NN .
Bellman ( 1957 ) has annunciated in the following terms :	NP ( CD ) HVZ VBN IN AT VBG NNS :
`` An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are , the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting from the first decision '' .	`` AT JJ NN HVZ AT NN CS WDT AT JJ NN CC JJ NN BER , AT VBG NNS MD VB AT JJ NN IN NN IN AT NN VBG IN AT OD NN '' .

Let the state of the stream leaving stage R be denoted by a vector Af and the operating variables of stage R by Af .	VB AT NN IN AT NN VBG NN NP BE VBN IN AT NN NN CC AT VBG NNS IN NN NP IN NN .
Thus Af denotes the state of the feed to the R-stage process , and Af the state of the product from the last stage .	RB NN VBZ AT NN IN AT NN IN AT NN NN , CC NN AT NN IN AT NN IN AT AP NN .
Each stage transforms the state Af of its feed to the state Af in a way that depends on the operating variables Af .	DT NN VBZ AT NN NN IN PP$ NN IN AT NN NN IN AT NN WPS VBZ IN AT VBG NNS NN .
We write this Af .	PPSS VB DT NN .
This transformation is uniquely determined by Af and we therefore speak of the process as deterministic .	DT NN BEZ RB VBN IN NN CC PPSS RB VB IN AT NN CS JJ .

The policy may not be unique but the maximum value of P certainly is , and once the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) as a function of the feed state Af .	AT NN MD * BE JJ CC AT JJ NN IN NN RB BEZ , CC CS AT NN BEZ VBN DT NN MD BE VBN IN ( CD ) CC ( CD ) CS AT NN IN AT NN NN NN .
Let Af where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af .	VB NN WRB AT NN BEZ IN ABN JJ NNS NN .
When it is necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy is an optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af .	WRB PPS BEZ JJ TO BE JJ PPSS VB CS AT JJ NN BEZ AT JJ NN NN IN NN IN AT NN NN NN .
For any choice of admissible policy Af in the first stage , the state of the stream leaving this stage is given by Af .	IN DTI NN IN JJ NN NN IN AT OD NN , AT NN IN AT NN VBG DT NN BEZ VBN IN NN .
This is the feed state of the subsequent Af stages which , according to the principle of optimality , must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to this state .	DT BEZ AT NN NN IN AT JJ NN NNS WDT , RB IN AT NN IN NN , MD VB AT JJ NN NN IN NN IN DT NN .
This will result in a value Af of the objective function , and when Af is chosen correctly this will give Af , the maximum of the objective function .	DT NN VB IN AT NN NN IN AT JJ NN , CC WRB NN BEZ VBN RB DT MD VB NN , AT NN IN AT JJ NN .
Thus Af where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af , and Af is related to Af by ( 5 ) .	RB NN WRB AT NN BEZ IN ABN JJ NNS NN , CC NN BEZ VBN IN NN IN ( CD ) .
The sequence of equations ( 6 ) can be solved for Af when Af is known , and clearly Af , the maximization being over all admissible Af .	AT NN IN NNS ( CD ) MD BE VBN IN NN WRB NN BEZ VBN , CC RB NN , AT NN BEG IN ABN JJ NN .
The set of equations ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and the starting equation ( 7 ) is of a recursive type well suited to programming on the digital computer .	AT NN IN NNS ( CD ) , ( CD ) , CC AT VBG NN ( CD ) BEZ IN AT JJ NN RB VBN IN VBG IN AT JJ NN .
In finding the optimal R-stage policy from that of Af stages , only the function Af is needed .	IN VBG AT JJ NN NN IN DT IN NN NNS , RB AT NN NN BEZ VBN .
When Af has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of Af and the whole calculation repeated .	WRB NN HVZ BEN VBN PPS MD BE VBN IN AT NN NN IN NN CC AT JJ NN VBN .
We also see how the results may be presented , although if n , the number of state variables , is large any tabulation will become cumbersome .	PPSS RB VB WRB AT NNS MD BE VBN , CS CS NN , AT NN IN NN NNS , BEZ JJ DTI NN MD VB JJ .
A table or set of tables may be set out as in Table 2.1 .	AT NN CC NN IN NNS MD BE VBN RP CS IN NN-TL CD-TL .
To extract the optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af , we enter section R of this table at the state Af and find immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective function .	TO VB AT JJ NN NN IN NN IN AT NN NN NN , PPSS VB NN NN IN DT NN IN AT NN NN CC VB RB IN AT AP NN AT JJ NN IN AT JJ NN .
In the third column is given the optimal policy for stage R , and in the fourth , the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used .	IN AT OD NN BEZ VBN AT JJ NN IN NN NN , CC IN AT OD , AT VBG NN IN AT NN WRB DT NN BEZ VBN .
Since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to Af , we may enter section Af of the table at this state Af and read off the optimal policy for stage Af and the resulting state Af .	CS IN AT NN IN NN AT VBG NNS VB AT JJ NN NN IN NN IN NN , PPSS MD VB NN NN IN AT NN IN DT NN NN CC VB IN AT JJ NN IN NN NN CC AT VBG NN NN .
Proceeding in this way up the table we extract the complete optimal policy and , if it is desired , we can check on Af by evaluating Af at the last stage .	VBG IN DT NN IN AT NN PPSS VB AT JJ JJ NN CC , CS PPS BEZ VBN , PPSS MD VB IN NN IN VBG NN IN AT AP NN .
It may be that the objective function depends not only on Af but also on Af , as when the cost of the operating policy is considered .	PPS MD BE CS AT JJ NN VBZ * RB IN NN CC RB IN NN , CS WRB AT NN IN AT VBG NN BEZ VBN .
A moment's reflection shows that the above algorithm and presentation work equally well in this case .	AT NN$ NN VBZ CS AT JJ NN CC NN VB QL RB IN DT NN .
A form of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider is Af .	AT NN IN JJ NN WPO PPSS MD RB HV NN TO VB BEZ NN .
Here P represents the value of the stream in state P and Q the cost of operating the stage with conditions Q .	RB NP VBZ AT NN IN AT NN IN NN NP CC NP AT NN IN VBG AT NN IN NNS NP .
Hence P is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation , that is , the net profit .	RB NN BEZ AT NN IN NN IN AT NN IN AT NN IN NN , DT BEZ , AT JJ NN .
If Af denotes the net profit from stage R and Af , then the principle of optimality gives Af .	CS NN VBZ AT NN NN IN NN NP CC NN , RB AT NN IN NN VBZ NN .
This sequence of equations may be started with the remark that with no process Af there is no profit , i.e. , Af .	DT NN IN NNS MD BE VBN IN AT NN CS IN AT NN NN EX BEZ AT NN , RB , NN .
2.3 the discrete stochastic process	CD-HL AT JJ JJ NN
The process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only statistically is also of interest , although for chemical reactor design it is not as important as the deterministic process .	AT NN IN WDT AT NN IN DTI CD NN BEZ VBN RB RB BEZ RB IN NN , CS IN NN NN NN PPS BEZ * QL JJ CS AT JJ NN .
In this case the stage R operating with conditions Af transforms the state of the stream from Af to Af , but only the probability distribution of Af is known .	IN DT NN AT NN NP VBG IN NNS NN VBZ AT NN IN AT NN IN NN IN NN , CC RB AT NN NN IN NN BEZ VBN .
This is specified by a distribution function Af such that the probability that Af lies in some region D of the stage space is Af .	DT BEZ VBN IN AT NN NN NN JJ CS AT NN CS NN VBZ IN DTI NN NN IN AT NN NN BEZ NN .
We cannot now speak of maximizing the value of the objective function , since this function is now known only in a probabilistic sense .	PPSS MD* RB VB IN VBG AT NN IN AT JJ NN , CS DT NN BEZ RB VBN RB IN AT JJ NN .
We can , however , maximize its expected value .	PPSS MD , RB , VB PP$ VBN NN .
For a single stage we may define Af where the maximization is by choice of Af .	IN AT AP NN PPSS MD VB NN WRB AT NN BEZ IN NN IN NN .
We thus have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected value of the objective function for a given Af .	PPSS RB HV AT JJ NN WDT VBZ AT VBN NN IN AT JJ NN IN AT VBN NN .
If we consider a process in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the next , then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first .	CS PPSS VB AT NN IN WDT AT NN IN CD NN BEZ VBN IN NN IN AT AP , RB AT NN IN NN VBZ CS AT NN IN JJ NNS MD BE JJ IN NN IN AT NN IN AT OD .
Then Af , the maximization being over all admissible Af and the integration over the whole of stage space .	RB NN , AT NN BEG IN ABN JJ NN CC AT NN IN AT NN IN NN NN .
The type of presentation of results used in the deterministic process may be used here , except that now the fourth column is redundant .	AT NN IN NN IN NNS VBN IN AT JJ NN MD BE VBN RB , IN CS RB AT OD NN BEZ JJ .
The third column gives the optimal policy , but we must wait to see the outcome of stage R and enter the preceding section of the table at this state .	AT OD NN VBZ AT JJ NN , CC PPSS MD VB TO VB AT NN IN NN NN CC VB AT VBG NN IN AT NN IN DT NN .
The discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter .	AT NN IN AT JJ NN WRB AT NN IN CD NN BEZ * VBN CS VBG IN AT AP BEZ AT QL QL QL JJ NN .
2.4 the continuous deterministic process	CD-HL AT JJ JJ NN
In many cases it is not possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages , since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner through the process .	IN AP NNS PPS BEZ * JJ TO VB AT NN IN AT JJ NN IN JJ NNS , CS AT NN IN AT NN BEZ VBN IN AT JJ NN IN AT NN .
We replace r , the number of the stage from the end of the process , by t , a continuous variable which measures the `` distance '' of the point considered from the end of the process .	PPSS VB NN , AT NN IN AT NN IN AT NN IN AT NN , IN NN , AT JJ JJ WDT VBZ AT `` NN '' IN AT NN VBN IN AT NN IN AT NN .
The word distance is used here in a rather general sense ; ;	AT NN NN-NC BEZ VBN RB IN AT QL JJ NN . .
it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the process .	PPS MD IN NN BE AT NN WPS MD VB IN AT NN IN AT NN .
If T is the total `` length '' of the process , its feed state may be denoted by a vector p(T) and the product state by p(Q) .	CS NN BEZ AT JJ `` NN '' IN AT NN , PP$ NN NN MD BE VBN IN AT NN NN CC AT NN NN IN NN .
P denotes the state at any point T and Q the vector of operating variables there .	NP VBZ AT NN IN DTI NN NP CC NP AT NN IN VBG NNS RB .
A gyro-stabilized platform system , using restrained gyros , is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination .	AT JJ NN NN , VBG VBN NNS , BEZ QL VBN IN JJ NN RB IN AT NNS IN AT NN NN .
The restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion , neglecting transient effects , as follows : Af where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro .	AT VBN JJ NN IN JJ NN NNS VBZ IN AT JJ NN IN NN , VBG JJ NNS , CS VBZ : NN WRB NN BEZ AT NN VBN IN AT NN NN IN AT VBG NN .
The platform angle **yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling .	AT NN NN NN BEZ AT NN IN WDT AT NN BEZ VBG .
This is normally termed the gyro input axis , 90-degrees away from the gyro output or **yj axis .	DT BEZ RB VBN AT NN NN NN , NNS RB IN AT NN NN CC NN NN .
The gyro angular momentum is defined by H .	AT NN JJ NN BEZ VBN IN NN .
Thus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the **yf axis , the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Af if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Aj .	RB CS AT NN CC NN NN VBZ AT NN IN CD JJ NN IN AT NN NN , AT NN MD BE VBN IN AT JJ NN NN CS AT NN BEZ VBN IN AT NN NN NN NN .
It is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output axes .	PPS BEZ VBN CS AT NNS BER VBN IN JJ NNS CS CS AT NN MD BE VBN IN PP$ NN NNS .
In the system shown in Fig. 7-1 , the accelerometer output is amplified and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro output-axis torquer .	IN AT NN VBN IN NN-TL CD-TL , AT NN NN BEZ VBN CC AT VBG NN BEZ VBN IN AT NN NN NN .
This torque causes the entire system to rotate about the **yf axis , since the response to Af .	DT NN VBZ AT JJ NN TO VB IN AT NN NN , CS AT NN IN NN .
If the polarities are correct , the platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero .	CS AT NNS BER JJ , AT NN VBZ IN ABL AT NN CS TO VB AT NN NN IN CD .
As the accelerometer output is decreasing , the torque applied to the gyro output axis decreases and , therefore , the rate decreases .	CS AT NN NN BEZ VBG , AT NN VBN IN AT NN NN NN VBZ CC , RB , AT NN VBZ .
Finally , when the accelerometer output is zero , the entire system remains stationary , and the platform is , by definition , leveled .	RB , WRB AT NN NN BEZ CD , AT JJ NN VBZ JJ , CC AT NN BEZ , IN NN , VBN .
A mathematical block diagram for the leveling system is shown in Fig. 7-2 .	AT JJ NN NN IN AT VBG NN BEZ VBN IN NN-TL CD-TL .
The platform is initially off level by the angle Aj .	AT NN BEZ RB IN JJ IN AT NN NN .
The angle generated by the platform servo **yf multiplied by G is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer .	AT NN VBN IN AT NN NN NN VBN IN NP BEZ AT JJ NN VBG IN AT NN .
Af is the scale factor of the accelerometer ( Af ) .	NN BEZ AT NN NN IN AT NN ( NN ) .
The voltage Af is amplified by Af and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor Af .	AT NN NN BEZ VBN IN NN CC VBN IN AT NN NN IN NN NN NN .
Finally , the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented by Af .	RB , AT JJ NN NN BEZ VBN IN NN .
The system as indicated in Fig. 7-2 is fundamental and simple because the transient effects of both the platform servo and the accelerometer have been neglected .	AT NN CS VBN IN NN-TL CD-TL BEZ JJ CC JJ CS AT JJ NNS IN ABX AT NN NN CC AT NN HV BEN VBN .
With these factors included , an upper limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability considerations .	IN DTS NNS VBN , AT JJ NN BEZ VBN IN AT JJ NN NN IN NN NNS .
In this type of system , a high loop gain is desirable because it provides a fast response time .	IN DT NN IN NN , AT JJ NN NN BEZ JJ CS PPS VBZ AT JJ NN NN .
When the frequency response characteristics of practical components are considered , their effect on stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain .	WRB AT NN NN NNS IN JJ NNS BER VBN , PP$ NN IN NN DOZ * VB AT QL JJ NN IN AT NN NN NN .
The time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately inversely proportional to the servo loop gain .	AT NN VBN IN AT NN TO VB AT JJ NN BEZ QL RB JJ IN AT NN NN NN .
In addition , the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is approximately proportional to the servo loop gain ; ;	IN NN , AT NN NN IN NN NNS BEZ QL JJ IN AT NN NN NN . .
i.e. , high loop gain causes the system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations .	RB , JJ NN NN VBZ AT NN TO VB IN JJ NNS IN NNS .
This problem usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time .	DT NN RB VBZ AT JJR NN IN NN NN RB CS NN NN .
It must be noticed in Fig. 7-1 that the accelerometer responds to any input acceleration .	PPS MD BE VBN IN NN-TL CD-TL CS AT NN VBZ IN DTI NN NN .
The equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is Af .	AT NN VBG NN NN IN NN NN NN BEZ NN .
In practice , the preflight leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe .	IN NN , AT JJ VBG NN VBZ NN IN AT NN VBN IN AT NN .
When the system is arranged for automatic leveling , the platform angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on the accelerometers .	WRB AT NN BEZ VBN IN JJ NN , AT NN NNS VB IN DTI JJ NNS IN NN VBG IN AT NNS .
There are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gusts , engine noise , turbulence around the vehicle , etc. .	EX BER AP JJ NNS IN NN RB RB IN AT NN IN NN NNS , NN NN , NN IN AT NN , RB .
One of the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of high-level acceleration noise .	CD IN AT JJT NNS VBN IN JJ NN BEZ VBG AT JJ NN IN AT NN IN NN NN NN .
One solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters .	CD NN IN AT NN BEZ TO VB IN AT JJ NN NN CC TO VB NN NNS .
This technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform tilt .	DT NN VBZ AT NN TO VB RB IN JJ NN NN NNS JJ CS AT NN NN .
Since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering increases the response time , a practical compromise must be reached .	CS AT JJR NN NN CC NN NN VBZ AT NN NN , AT JJ NN MD BE VBN .
One of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the use of a non-linear amplifier for Af .	CD IN AT QL JJ NNS BEZ VBN IN AT NN IN AT JJ NN IN NN .
The amplifier is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level .	AT NN BEZ VBN CS CS PP$ NN BEZ JJ IN NN NNS IN AT AP NN NN .
Below this level , the amplifier gain Af is proportional and is of small value , in order to provide adequate noise filtering .	IN DT NN , AT NN NN NN BEZ JJ CC BEZ IN JJ NN , IN NN TO VB JJ NN NN .
The effect is that the platform returns from an off-level position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level , at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process .	AT NN BEZ CS AT NN VBZ IN AT JJ NN IN AT JJ NN CS PPS BEZ QL JJ , IN WDT NN AT NN BEZ VBN IN AT JJ NN IN JJ QLP NN NN CS CS AT NN HVZ AP NN IN AT VBG NN .
When the system is on automatic leveling , the gyro drift is canceled by the output of the leveling system ( amplifier Af ) .	WRB AT NN BEZ IN JJ NN , AT NN NN BEZ VBN IN AT NN IN AT VBG NN ( NN NN ) .
The platform actually tilts off level so that the accelerometer output , when amplified by Af , will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel the gyro drift .	AT NN RB VBZ IN JJ CS CS AT NN NN , WRB VBN IN NN , MD VB AT JJ NN IN AT NN NN TO VB AT NN NN .
The amount of platform dip required depends upon the scale factors of the system .	AT NN IN NN NN VBN VBZ IN AT NN NNS IN AT NN .

Practical leveling considerations .	JJ-HL VBG-HL NNS-HL .-HL
The automatic leveling system described in this section is readily adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three integrating gyros .	AT JJ VBG NN VBN IN DT NN BEZ RB JJ IN AT JJ NN VBG IN CD VBG NNS .
The system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits .	AT NN VBZ DTI NN IN NN NN NNS .
However , the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform .	RB , AT VBG NN MD BE VBN CC VBN RB IN AT JJ CC JJ NN IN AT NN .
This leveling system will hold the platform on-level , automatically , as long as the system is actuated .	DT VBG NN MD VB AT NN JJ , RB , QL RB CS AT NN BEZ VBN .
A useful by-product of this system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift biases is available from the currents necessary to hold the system in level .	AT JJ NN IN DT NN BEZ CS AT NN JJ TO VB AT NN NN NNS BEZ JJ IN AT NNS JJ TO VB AT NN IN JJ .
The leveling process can be accomplished manually , and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment .	AT VBG NN MD BE VBN RB , CC AT NNS BER QL JJ CS DTS VBN IN JJ NN .
The process consists in turning the platform manually until the outputs of both accelerometers are zero .	AT NN VBZ IN VBG AT NN RB CS AT NNS IN ABX NNS BER CD .
The turning is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro torquers described above .	AT NN BEZ VBN IN VBG NN IN AT NN NNS VBN RB .
In brief , the human replaces amplifier Af in Figs. 7-1 and 7-2 .	IN JJ , AT NN VBZ NN NN IN NNS-TL CD-TL CC CD-TL .
Manual leveling requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs .	JJ NN VBZ AT JJ NN IN AT NN NNS .
If high accuracy is required in preflight leveling , it is usually necessary to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs ( this also minimizes the noise problem ) .	CS JJ NN BEZ VBN IN JJ NN , PPS BEZ RB JJ TO VB CC RB VB AT NN NNS ( DT RB VBZ AT NN NN ) .
With integration , the effect of a small acceleration ( or small platform tilt angle ) can be seen after a time .	IN NN , AT NN IN AT JJ NN ( CC JJ NN NN NN ) MD BE VBN IN AT NN .
However , skill is required on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy .	RB , NN BEZ VBN IN AT NN IN AT NN TO VB AT NN IN DTI NN IN NN .
Also , it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach .	RB , PPS VBZ AP NN CS VBN IN AT JJ NN .
Manual leveling is inconvenient if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged period of time .	JJ NN BEZ JJ CS AT NN MD BE VBN RB JJ IN DTI VBN NN IN NN .
The operator must continually supply the correct amount of turning current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of gyro drift is canceled .	AT NN MD RB VB AT JJ NN IN VBG NN IN AT NN NNS CS CS AT NN IN NN NN BEZ VBN .
This process is especially difficult since gyro drifting is typically random .	DT NN BEZ QL JJ CS NN VBG BEZ RB JJ .

Platform heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers parallel to the desired coordinate system of the navigator .	NN NN VBZ IN VBG AT JJ NN IN AT NNS RB IN AT VBN NN NN IN AT NN .
In simpler terms , it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction .	IN JJR NNS , PPS VBZ IN VBG AT NN IN AT JJ NN .

With the gyro-stabilized platform leveled , it can be headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques .	IN AT JJ NN VBN , PPS MD BE VBN IN AT JJ NN IN VBG VBG NNS .
The platform accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure .	AT NN NNS MD BE QL VBN IN DT NN .
Before the accelerometers are mounted on the platform , the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined .	CS AT NNS BER VBN IN AT NN , AT NN IN PP$ JJ NN MD BE RB VBN .
A mirror is mounted on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is perpendicular to the sensitive axis of the unit .	AT NN BEZ VBN IN DT NN CS CS AT NN IN AT NN BEZ JJ IN AT JJ NN IN AT NN .
Transit .	NN-HL .-HL
A precision transit is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north .	AT NN NN BEZ VBN RP CS CS PPS BEZ VBN IN NN IN JJ NN .
This can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques .	DT MD BE VBN IN AT JJ NN IN NN IN VBG VBG NNS .
With the transit set up , a mirror on one of the accelerometers is sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned .	IN AT NN VBN RP , AT NN IN CD IN AT NNS BEZ VBN CC AT NN BEZ VBN CS PPS BEZ VBN .
The sighting procedure includes the use of a fixture for the transit to project a beam of light , which is darkened by crossed hairs , on the accelerometer mirror .	AT VBG NN VBZ AT NN IN AT NN IN AT NN TO VB AT NN IN NN , WDT BEZ VBN IN VBN NNS , IN AT NN NN .
When the platform is aligned , the reflected image of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed upon the original crossed hairs .	WRB AT NN BEZ VBN , AT VBN NN IN AT VBN NNS MD BE VBN RB VBN IN AT JJ VBN NNS .
The images can easily be aligned with a high degree of accuracy .	AT NNS MD RB BE VBN IN AT JJ NN IN NN .
The platform is turned as required by supplying currents to the appropriate gyro torquers .	AT NN BEZ VBN CS VBN IN VBG NNS IN AT JJ NN NNS .
Although this technique is simple and satisfactory , one practical difficulty does exist : the direction of true north must be known for each launch point .	CS DT NN BEZ JJ CC JJ , CD JJ NN DOZ VB : AT NN IN JJ NN MD BE VBN IN DT NN NN .
However , this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few days' work .	RB , DT NN BEZ * QL JJ CS PPS BEZ VBN CS AT VBG NN MD VB AT JJ NN NN NN IN AT AP NNS$ NN .
In many installations , the inertial platform is raised off the ground a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight .	IN AP NNS , AT JJ NN BEZ VBN IN AT NN AT JJ NN WRB PPS BEZ VBN IN AT NN IN NN .
With this situation , it is difficult to sight in on the platform with surveying equipment .	IN DT NN , PPS BEZ JJ TO VB RP IN AT NN IN VBG NN .
If the platform is not too high off the ground , a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform .	CS AT NN BEZ * QL RB IN AT NN , AT NN MD BE VBN IN AT NN TO VB PPO RP IN AT NN .

Autocollimator .	NN-HL .-HL
The transit can be replaced by an autocollimator .	AT NN MD BE VBN IN AT NN .
This instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading .	DT NN VBZ AT JJ NN JJ IN AT JJ NNS IN AT NN CC MD BE VBN TO RB VB AT NN IN JJ NN .
The electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified and supplied to the Z-gyro torquer .	AT JJ NN IN AT NN BEZ VBN CC VBN IN AT NN NN .
If the polarity is correct , the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero .	CS AT NN BEZ JJ , AT NN MD VB CS AT NN NN NN BEZ CD .
Information is also available from this autocollimator system to set the drift bias for the Z-axis gyro .	NN BEZ RB JJ IN DT NN NN TO VB AT NN NN IN AT NN NN .
If the Z gyro is drifting , a current generated by the autocollimator is delivered to the gyro torquer to cancel the drift .	CS AT NN NN BEZ VBG , AT NN VBN IN AT NN BEZ VBN IN AT NN NN TO VB AT NN .

For the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consisting of three restrained gyros , a coordinate system is used where the sensitive axis of the X accelerometer is parallel to the east-west direction at the base point , and the Y accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the north-south direction at the base point .

His parents talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the University Hospital -- Mr. McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family -- and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off , spend a lot of time in bed and , for the rest , do pretty much as he chose -- provided , of course , he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating .
